zabbix-glpi
===========

Python and PHP scripts for integration between Zabbix and GLPI. The goal is to automatically open and close tickets from an event that occurred in Zabbix, involving the status of a trigger. More information about implementing this solution can be found on my blog: http://blog.janssenlima.com/2013/11/integracao-zabbix-glpi.html
